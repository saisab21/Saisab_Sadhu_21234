# Submission Instructions

Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure your submission is accepted and properly evaluated.

## Submission Process

1. **Code and Report Submission:**
   - Create a GitHub repository named `FirstName LastName RollNo` (replace with your actual first name, last name, and roll number).
   - Upload both your code and the report to this repository. Ensure your code is organized and well-commented, and your report follows the guidelines provided in the LaTeX template.
   
2. **Sharing Your Work:**
   - Once you have uploaded all the required files to your repository, share the GitHub repo link via the shared form on the classroom platform. Make sure your repository is public or accessible to the instructors and TAs.

## Technical Assistance

- **Self-Help Encouraged:** Setting up the environment, encountering, and resolving technical issues are part of the learning process. We encourage you to use resources such as Google, StackOverflow, and YouTube tutorials to find solutions to any problems you may face.
- **Note:** Direct assistance from instructors or TAs regarding technical problems will not be provided. This policy encourages independent problem-solving and research skills.

## Problem Specifications

- **Assumptions:** If you encounter any portion of the problem that seems under-specified, assume it is intentional. You are free to make reasonable assumptions to proceed with your solution. However, clearly specify any assumptions you make in your report.
- **Clarifications:** No further clarifications on the problems will be provided beyond what is stated. If you believe there is an error in the problem specifications, feel free to contact the TAs for guidance.

Thank you for your attention to these guidelines, and best of luck with your submission!
